# WWF Royal Rumble Strategy Guide

### Languages / Protocols / Tools
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Visual Studio Code, Git Hub

### Project Details
- This is similar to my Mortal Kombat strategy guide project. I wanted a second "playground" of sorts.
- The goal remains the same. I want to tap into things I was interested in doing as a kid, marry them to my current projects, and create something that a younger me would have enjoyed.

## Focus Moving Forward
- Detect and resolve bugs
- Improve stability
- Enhnace the overall user experience
